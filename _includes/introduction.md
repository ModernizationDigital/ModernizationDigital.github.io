# Digital Transformation - 1Team

Hi Mary, testing 1234. 

Don't worry, it's not time to start rocking and crying in a corner. Our goal is to make this interesting. Can you imagine a playbook for work that you would look forward to checking in to see what has changed? 

What if it was interesting enough that you'd grab your afternoon tea, put your calls and meetings on hold and enjoy learning? What if this playbook made you want to work in this industry. 

Hopefully it will, cause it's the most interesting and one of the fastest growing industries with so many sub industries and career paths. What's really fascinating about including cloud migration in your modernization path is that it all makes sense. How did people figure this out. 

Remember the first time you saw a printer print wirelessly. I just remember thinking: How does it do that? It just went from here; to there. How can some thing I typed on my computer magically go to this device and now I'm holding a piece of paper with everything I typed. That's amazing.

I'm trying to find a playbook template to start out with. i sort of like when you scroll down the links to the plays come up and stay at the top. that's different. I like the font; and treament of the word PLAY... the rest of the typography can go. 

I'm trying to see if I can set up a few for you to choose which would be a good starting point for us this month. Something functional w/out all the bells and whistles. Most don't have that. but still I'd like the layout to be something where we could start to create something engaging. testing
