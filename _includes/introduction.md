Cloud Migration, Digital Transformation and Modernization all lead to so many sub industries and career paths. As you progress in industry knowledge you might be excited to see that all this cloud stuff actually makes sense. Mary, we can do our intro here.  

Remember the first time you saw a printer print wirelessly. It's actually quite fascinating. You have a document on your computer, you press a button and magically your document printed on a separated machine, exactly as you wanted it. Isn't that amazing! How does that work? Now we fastforward 12 years and we've scaled that up exponentially to Data Centers â€” where our data and files that we put in the cloud are located. 

what i like about this template: 
when you scroll down, links to plays come up and stay at the top. that's different. 
I like the treament of: Play 1, Play 2, etc... the rest of the typography can go. 
It will be easy to change the color, font, logos? of this and just port in basic copy:
Intro; Plays 1-10; highlight containers & faster deployement... as part of a play or in a section on it own... 

Plus w/GitHub pages; I can make a duplicate of this; we can have a live and working site.
