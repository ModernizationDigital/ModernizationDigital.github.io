# Digital Transformation - 1Team

Hi Mary, testing 1234. 

I'm trying to find a playbook template to start out with. i sort of like when you scroll down the links to the plays come up and stay at the top. that's different. I like the font; and treament of the word PLAY... the rest of the typography can go. 

I'm trying to see if I can set up a few for you to choose which would be a good starting point for us this month. Something functional w/out all the bells and whistles. Most don't have that. but still I'd like the layout to be something where we could start to create something engaging. testing
