# Digital Transformation - 1Team

Hi Mary, testing 1234. 

Note to our readers: Can you imagine a playbook for work that you would look forward to checking in to see what has changed? What if this playbook made you want to learn more? 

Digital Modernization leads to so many sub industries and career paths. As you progress in your industry knowledge you see it all makes sense.  

Remember the first time you saw a printer print wirelessly. It's actually quite fascinating. How did people figure this out? Some thing I typed on my computer magically went to another device and now I'm holding a piece of paper with everything I typed. That's amazing. Now we've scaled that up exponentially to data servers - where our data and files that we put in the cloud are located. 

what i like about this template: 
when you scroll down, links to plays come up and stay at the top. that's different. 
I like the font; of the word PLAY and treament o... the rest of the typography can go.
