# Modernization Playbook by OneTeam

Hi Mary, testing 1234. I'm trying to find a playbook template to start out with. I'm trying to see if I can set up a few for you to choose which would be a good starting point for us this month. Something functional w/out all the bells and whistles. Most don't have that. but still I'd like the layout to be something where we could start to create something engaging. testing
